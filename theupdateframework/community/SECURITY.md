# Security Policy

If you want to report security issues for a TUF project, please consult with
any local security policy first.

If no local policy is available, or the security issue is not related to a
specific project, please report to the [TUF community security
contact](PEOPLE.md#security-contact) via email, ideally encrypted with PGP.

The report should contain at least:

- a description of the vulnerability, and
- steps to reproduce the issue.

Please do not use GitHub issue trackers to submit vulnerability reports. The
issue tracker is intended for bug reports and feature requests. Major feature
requests, such as design changes to the specification, should be proposed via a
[TUF Augmentation Proposal](https://github.com/theupdateframework/taps) (TAP).
