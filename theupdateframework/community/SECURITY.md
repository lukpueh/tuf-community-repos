# Security Policy

If you want to report security issues for any project in the TUF organization,
please consult with the Security Policy of the corresponding
`https://github.com/theupdateframework/<project name>/security/policy`.

[TODO: Revise or remove theupdateframework/tuf's, which talks about software
updater security when it should talk about project security]

Security issues that are not related to a specific project, or if no custom
security policy document exist, please report to any or multiple of the TUF
steering comittee members, via email ideally encrypted with PGP.

[TODO: Link to list of steering committee members (including PGP fingerprint),
or use dedicated steering comittee security contact?]

The report should contain:

- a description of the vulnerability, and
- steps to reproduce the issue.

Please do not use GitHub issue trackers to submit vulnerability reports. The
issue tracker is intended for bug reports and feature requests. Major feature
requests, such as design changes to the specification, should be proposed via a
[TUF Augmentation Proposal](https://github.com/theupdateframework/taps) (TAP).
