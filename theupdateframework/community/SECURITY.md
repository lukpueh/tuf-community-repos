# Security Policy

If you want to report security issues for a TUF project, please consult with
any project-specific security policy first.

If no such policy is available, or the security issue is not related to a
specific project, please report to the [TUF community security
contact](PEOPLE.md#security-contact) via email, ideally encrypted with PGP.

<!--
TODO:
- The TUF community security contact does not exist yet (see PEOPLE.md)
- Goal: No one person should become a bottle neck for resolving security issues.
- Encouraging the use of PGP might be problematic.
See https://buttondown.email/cryptography-dispatches/archive/505a859e-964d-4d15-9ad8-7ad0f45e1345
- Should we provide a HTTPS web form instead?
 -->

The report should contain at least:

- a description of the vulnerability, and
- steps to reproduce the issue.

Please do not use GitHub issue trackers to submit vulnerability reports. The
issue tracker is intended for bug reports and feature requests. 

Major feature requests, such as design changes to the specification, should be proposed via a
[TUF Augmentation Proposal](https://github.com/theupdateframework/taps) (TAP).
