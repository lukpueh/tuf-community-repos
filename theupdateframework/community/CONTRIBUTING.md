# Contributing

## ... to the TUF Community
If you want to propose a change in governance or any of the related documents
in this repository, just open a GitHub issue or submit a pull request.

Details about how a project may become part of the TUF community can be found
in the [*Adding Subprojects*](GOVERNANCE.md#adding-subprojects) section of the
organization's governance document.

If a new project is added to the TUF organization, the following documents must
be updated:

- [PROJECTS.md](PROJECTS.md) -- Add project name and description.
- [PEOPLE.md](PEOPLE.md) --  Add selected steering committee subproject
  maintainer representative.

Note that some [community health
files](https://github.com/theupdateframework/.github) are automatically
populated in all repositories in the TUF GitHub organization. If you want to
establish subproject-specific guidelines, feel free to override the default
documents as described in the *GitHub Default Community Health File*
[docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/creating-a-default-community-health-file).

## ... to a TUF Project
[TUF projects](PROJECTS.md) may have project-specific contributing guidelines.
If available, please refer to those first. Otherwise, just open a GitHub issue
or submit a pull request on the corresponding project repository.

## And don't forget!
Please always follow the TUF community [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md),
or any project-specific code if available!
