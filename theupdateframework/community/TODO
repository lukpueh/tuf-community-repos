# TODO

Ideas for documents that we could add to this repo, and/or that currently live
in theupdateframework/tuf and need to be moved or revised.

--> Maybe ticketize in github.com/theupdateframework/community/issues

- issues/pr templates related to community governance
- issues/pr templates related to TUF projects

- Cool feature idea, handy for TUF projects (or really any OSS project):
  Auto-maintain MAINTAINERS.txt using people (collaborators/members) and teams
  info queried from the GitHub API.

  **Some preliminary thoughts and resource pointers**

  - Can this be done with a GitHub Actions [1] or does it need a GitHub App [2]
    and how so webhooks [3] fit in?
  - Trigger on MemberEvent [4] or poll API regularly [5] to detect changes?
    - Can a GitHub Action listen for MemberEvent?
    - Does MemberEvent cover everything we need? Eg. is it triggered when
      permissions change due to a change in GitHub team membership?
  - Which GitHub permissions qualify someone for being added to MAINTAINERS.txt?
    admin|maintain probably, push|triage|pull maybe?
  - Permission == responsibility? Not every owner/admin is a maintainer.
  - What information should go into the file?
    GitHub handle, email (spam?) and gpg, etc. [6],[7]
  - Be careful to not make private information (personal details or even just
    affiliation) public.
  - The feature should submit a PR, because a change in MAINTAINERS.txt must be
    reviewed by a human.

  - Is this really all worth it? MAINTAINERS.txt doesn't change that often.
    - Only if it is good and generic enough to be used by other OSS projects.
    - This feels like a supply chain transparency/security feature, and the
      supply chain is our trade.
    - Maybe this could be a fun self-contained student project

  (credits to @SantiagoTorres, who had the initial idea)

- Revise current people and teams permissions of TUF projects
  - See corresponding private mail thread for evaluation of status quo
  - Maybe too sensitive to be discussed on a public issue tracker

- https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/blob/develop/docs/AUTHORS.txt
  - The list of orgs and individuals makes it seem a better fit for
    the community repo
  - Maybe as part of PEOPLE.md
  - AUTHORS.txt vs. MAINTAINERS.txt vs. Acknowledgments (README.md)??
    Their purpose seems to overlap, and not all seem up-to-date.
  - Is it even worth maintaining such a document?

- https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/commits/develop/docs/GOVERNANCE.md
  - Intent overlaps with new community governance
  - Needs revision if it stays in theupdateframework/tuf

- https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/blob/develop/docs/TAP.rst
  - Maybe also a good fit for this repo? Maybe as part of CONTRIBUTING.md?
  - Feels a bit lost in theupdateframework/tuf


- Acknowledgements
  TODO: Maybe this document is a good place to bundle Acknowledgements
  https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf#acknowledgements
  https://github.com/theupdateframework/specification#acknowledgements
  https://github.com/theupdateframework/taps#acknowledgements

- https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/blob/develop/docs/SECURITY.md
  - Rename!!
  - It talks about software updater security when it should talk about
    project security
  - The default community security policy is probably enough for
    theupdateframework/tuf.
