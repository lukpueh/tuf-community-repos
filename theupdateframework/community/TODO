# TODO

Ideas for documents that we could add to this repo, and/or that currently live
in theupdateframework/tuf and need to be moved or revised.

--> Maybe ticketize in github.com/theupdateframework/community/issues

- issues/pr templates related to community governance
- issues/pr templates related to TUF projects

- https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/blob/develop/docs/AUTHORS.txt
  - The list of orgs and individuals makes it seem a better fit for
    the community repo
  - Maybe as part of PEOPLE.md
  - AUTHORS.txt vs. MAINTAINERS.txt vs. Acknowledgements (README.md)??
    Their purpose seems to overlap, and not all seem up-to-date.
  - Is it even worth maintaining such a document?

- https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/commits/develop/docs/GOVERNANCE.md
  - Intent overlaps with new community governance
  - Needs revision if it stays in theupdateframework/tuf

- https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/blob/develop/docs/TAP.rst
  - Maybe also a good fit for this repo? Maybe as part of CONTRIBUTING.md?
  - Feels a bit lost in theupdateframework/tuf
