# TODO

Ideas for documents that we could add to this repo, and/or that currently live
in theupdateframework/tuf and need to be moved or revised.

--> Maybe ticketize in github.com/theupdateframework/community/issues

- issues/pr templates related to community governance
- issues/pr templates related to TUF projects

- Cool feature, handy for TUF projects (or really any OSS project):
  GitHub Action that syncs MAINTAINERS.txt with people and teams info queried
  from the GitHub API.
  - See https://gist.github.com/lukpueh/42c23c35c7cc23ab194bda2db39779bf
  - Ping Lukas for existing ideas in his notes!!

- Revise current people and teams permissions of TUF projects
  - See corresponding private mail thread for evaluation of status quo
  - Maybe too sensitive to be discussed on a public issue tracker

- https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/blob/develop/docs/AUTHORS.txt
  - The list of orgs and individuals makes it seem a better fit for
    the community repo
  - Maybe as part of PEOPLE.md
  - AUTHORS.txt vs. MAINTAINERS.txt vs. Acknowledgements (README.md)??
    Their purpose seems to overlap, and not all seem up-to-date.
  - Is it even worth maintaining such a document?

- https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/commits/develop/docs/GOVERNANCE.md
  - Intent overlaps with new community governance
  - Needs revision if it stays in theupdateframework/tuf

- https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/blob/develop/docs/TAP.rst
  - Maybe also a good fit for this repo? Maybe as part of CONTRIBUTING.md?
  - Feels a bit lost in theupdateframework/tuf


- Acknowledgements
  TODO: Maybe this document is a good place to bundle Acknowledgements
  https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf#acknowledgements
  https://github.com/theupdateframework/specification#acknowledgements
  https://github.com/theupdateframework/taps#acknowledgements

- https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/blob/develop/docs/SECURITY.md
  - Rename!!
  - It talks about software updater security when it should talk about
    project security
  - The default community security policy is propably enough for
    theupdateframework/tuf.
