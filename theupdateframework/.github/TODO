# TODO

Ideas for documents supported in the "<github organization>/.github" repo.
https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/creating-a-default-community-health-file

--> Maybe ticketize these in github.com/theupdateframework/community/issues

- SUPPORT.md: Should we add a default one that links to
  theupdateframework/community/SUPPORT.md akin to CONTRIBUTING.md?
  or it just directly links to any or mlutiple of README.md, PEOPLE.md,
  CONTRIBUTING.md in theupdateframework/community?
